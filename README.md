4. As a foreign tourist, I want to know the location and opening hours so that I can plan my trip well.
5. As a market manager, I want to post job openings so that I can attract potential employees.
6. As a vendor, I want to highlight special promotions so that I can increase sales.
7. As a consumer, I want to submit feedback or report issues through the app so that I can help improve the shopping experience and resolve problems quickly.
8. As a vendor, I want to find available rental spaces in the mall so that I can set up my store in an ideal location.
